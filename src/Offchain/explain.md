### Purpose of these scripts

Here we are demonstrating a simulation of Locking FUnds to script, MInting NFT, and unlocking the funds.

This is just for practice, and to show how we can use COntract Monad in order to write offchain code within a Plutus COntract.

ALso, we can test the endpoints using EMulatorTrace monad for unit testing.

A more advanced implementation of a StateMachine example with Property Based Testing is under construction..... ;)
